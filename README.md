# Programming Books Exercise
This website exemplifies my ability to convert web components to React components in order to display information on a centralized website.
This website contains a list of self-help programming books that are well organized into cards and tables using bootstrap. These tables organize all the important information you would need to know about the specific book. The files are well organized and easily adaptable. The styles of the tables are adaptable in a few lines of code, rather than having to scroll through all the information of each book to find where the table properties are set. 

## How to Run?
Download the files to a local folder and run using http-server.

## Roadmap of Future Impovements
I would like to add a picture for each book at the top of each card. I would need to save png files for each book and format it using bootstrap. 

## License Information
This exercise was created as an assignment for the MIT xPRO Full Stack Web Development program.
